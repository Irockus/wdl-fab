CMake portable build environment:
	OSX: 
		- bundle macro generation must be finalized to generate proper audiounit bundles, for now WIP (only resource .r file needs to be added to the automatic process). 
		- aax,rtas builds not tested yet though populated, as I don't have these frameworks.
	
Doxygen Documentation:
	- More documentation should be provided, lots of TBC/place holders for now.
	- Tutorials following the examples material as a start would be nice.

Code refactoring / Clean-up effort:
	- a new portab.h include file should be create and encapsulate once for all any cross platform and/or compiler specificities
		WIP, portab.h has been created in the iPlug lib.
			
Performances:
	- Interlock mechanism needs to be revisited
