CMake portable build environment:
	OSX: 
		- resources files bundle copy does not specify sub-folders yet seems to be a current limitation/bug of cmake
		- bundle macro generation must be finalized to generate proper vst and au bundles, for now WIP. 
		- aax,rtas builds not implemented at all, as I don't have these frameworks.
	Windows
		- improvements of the find library features to incorporate more easily extra deps (i.e. 3rd party audio libs ...)
		
Doxygen Documentation:
	- More documentation should be provided, lots of TBC/place holders for now.
	- Tutorials following the examples material as a start would be nice.

Code refactoring / Clean-up effort:
	- a new portab.h include file should be create and encapsulate once for all any cross platform and/or compiler specificities
	
Performances:
	- Interlock mechanism needs to be revisited
