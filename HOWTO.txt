A. How to build the distribution ?
-----------------------------------

1. Go to the build directory and run the script of your choice for your target toolchain 
   (Advanced: or run cmake manually and customize the generation to any 
    cmake supported toolchain ...)
2. Now a win or osx subdirectory appears, open it and select the Project solution 
3. Enjoy a fully automatically generated build !

B. How to quickly create my own iPlug Projects ?
------------------------------------------------

1. Go to the IPlugProjects directory
2. Copy an example or existing iPlug Project folder of your choice here (i.e. MyNewProjA)
3. Inside MyNewProjA, update or create if not exist the file named CMakeLists.txt 
	and populate your sources files.
	(resources can also be customized very easily see examples project)
4. Run the cmake automatic project generation again incrementally until you're satisfied 
	with your new added builds.
	
	Note that you dont even need to tell what new project you copied as the script 
	dynamic subfolder iteration autodetects any subfolder under IPlugProjects 
	and add it for you into the main build project !
