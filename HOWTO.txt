A. How to build the distribution ?
-----------------------------------
0. Install cmake (2.8+) if not installed yet, available from:
   http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
   Also populate needed VST/VST3/AU/AAX/RTAS SDKs folders as instructed in their respectives README.txt files
1. Go to the build directory and run the script of your choice for your target toolchain 
   (Advanced: or run cmake manually and customize the generation to any 
    cmake supported toolchain ...)
2. Now a win or osx subdirectory appears, open it and select the Project solution 
3. Enjoy a fully automatically generated build !

B. How to quickly create my own iPlug Projects ?
------------------------------------------------

1. Go to the IPlugProjects directory
2. Copy an example or existing iPlug Project folder of your choice here (i.e. MyNewProjA)
3. Inside MyNewProjA, update or create if not exist the file named CMakeLists.txt 
	and populate your sources files.
	(resources can also be customized very easily see example projects)
4. Run the cmake automatic project generation again incrementally until you're satisfied 
	with your new added builds.
	
	Note that you dont even need to tell what new project you copied as the script 
	dynamic subfolder iteration autodetects any subfolder under IPlugProjects 
	and adds it for you into the main build project !

Notes:

===============
XCode4/5 users:
===============
1. You need to right click on the XCode app and select "Show package contents"...
Then in Contents/Developer add an Extras folder with the CoreAudio SDK
that can be downloaded from:
	https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/CoreAudioUtilityClasses/Introduction/Intro.html
	(then click download sample code)

2. for OSX SDKs > 10.6 builds :
	For building with SDKS > 10.6, edit the ./cmake/IPlugSdkVersion.inc file 
	and uncomment only the SDK lines that correspond to what you have:
	
 i.e. for XCode5 (without SDK10.6) update this section in the file as see below :
 
	# 1. Set to ON only the SDKs you have as listed below:
	#   By default it assumes 106 is available
	#set(HAVE_SDK106  ON)
	#set(HAVE_SDK107  ON)
	set(HAVE_SDK108  ON)
	set(HAVE_SDK109  ON)
	#set(HAVE_SDK1010 ON)
